# Virtual Worlds with Cylinders
Projects 1-4 done by: Ivan Martinez-Arias<br>
Project 5 done by: Ivan Martinez-Arias & Alan Chen

## Description
These projects were done for a Computer Graphics class at the University of California, Santa Cruz to create a virtual world using low-level graphics language (WebGL). At the end of the class with the experience of creating graphics with WebGL, we were tasked with exploring high-level graphics libraries.<br>

As our final project, we had to create a scene with similar aspects from the previous projects, containing a dynamic scene with lighting, camera, and objects where users can manipulate the objects and/or camera interactivity.
