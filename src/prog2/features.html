    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        A program that contains a 3D environment where users are able to create colored cylinders with N sides 
        and are able to perform transformations on each cylinder object utilizing Matrix Transformations. The 
        possible transformations users can choose from are Translations, Rotations, and Scaling.<br>

        Each side of the cylinder object contains Normals to perform Flat Shading depending where the light source 
        is. Depending on the user input, users can render the objects placed onto the WebGL Canvas and switch 
        between Flat Shading or Wireframes through a toggle button.<br>

        The program starts with a Mallet Object created already in the main() function, 
        having 2 cylinders connected and transformed individually.

    <!-- GUIDE TO USE PROGRAM -->
    <h2>Guide to Use Program:</h2>
    <u>Creating / Controlling Cylinders</u>
    <p>
        - To create a cylinder, you must input an N number that will represent the number of sides for the cylinder. 
        Below the number input is a Color Box, where the user can decide what color shading the user wants on their 
        created cylidner. Once the user has decided on N and the Color, they can click on "Add" to create the new cylinder.<br>
        - To control a specific cylinder, users can click on the drop down menu containing all created cylinders and click 
        on the numbered cylinder they would like to control.<br>
        - To make every cylinder into a wireframe rather than completely filled out, users can use the "Wireframe" checkbox 
        to view the wireframes of each cylinder.
    </p>
    <u>Transformations of Cylinders</u>
    <p>
       - Users are able to transform each Cylinder Object through 3 options: Translate, Rotate, and Scale. Each transformation 
       has 3 slides that are assigned to each axis on the 3D plane. Each slider performs the appropriate transformation depending 
       on which axis it is being used on.
    </p>
    
    <!-- ISSUES -->
    <h2>Issues:</h2>
    <p>
        <b><u>NOTE:</u></b> I am not 100% certain whether these are truly issues or not on the program, however they are 
        things that I have noticed.<br>
        * Depending on the perspective of the object, when scaling the z-axis of the cylinder the brightness/lighting of the 
        bottom or top of the cylinder dims down when increasing the z-axis. The opposite is true when decreasing the z-axis 
        as it will become brighter.<br>
        * When translating the z-axis to the max on either side of the slider, the object will clip through the canvas and show 
        the insides of the object.
