    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        A program that contains a 3D environment where objects created by the user can have different types of 
        shading: Flat Shading, Wireframes, and Smooth Shading. Smooth Shading is done through Gouraud Shading, 
        utilizing all three ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to present a light source hitting the surfaces 
        of each object cylinder.
        <br>

        Inside the Cylinder Class Object contains two sets of normals for each appropriate shading option. Smooth 
        normals for smooth shading were calculated through the sum of each vertex normal on each cylinder face. 
        <br>

        In the world contains two light sources where one light source is only one directional 
        while the other light source can be controlled by the user. Each light source provides appropriate lighting 
        effects using ambient and specular lighting, where ambient lighting provides a softer appearance of the object 
        while specular lighting provides the glossiness part of the object where the light peaks the most.

    <!-- GUIDE TO USE PROGRAM -->
    <h3>Guide to Use Program:</h3>
    <u>Creating / Controlling Cylinders</u>
    <p>
        - To create a cylinder, you must input an N number that will represent the number of sides for the cylinder. 
        Below the number input is a Color Box, where the user can decide what color shading the user wants on their 
        created cylidner. Once the user has decided on N and the Color, they can click on "Add" to create the new cylinder.<br>
        - To control a specific cylinder, users can click on the drop down menu containing all created cylinders and click 
        on the numbered cylinder they would like to control.<br>
        - To make every cylinder into a wireframe rather than completely filled out, users can use the "Wireframe" checkbox 
        to view the wireframes of each cylinder.
    </p>
    <u>Transformations of Cylinders</u>
    <p>
       - Users are able to transform each Cylinder Object through 3 options: Translate, Rotate, and Scale. Each transformation 
       has 3 slides that are assigned to each axis on the 3D plane. Each slider performs the appropriate transformation depending 
       on which axis it is being used on.
    </p>
    <u>Choosing Type of Shading / Updating the Canvas</u>
    <p>
        Below the user input of the cylinders, there is a Shading List that contains three possible choices: 
        Flat Shading, Smooth Shading, and Wireframes. Choosing one from the list will adjust how each object on the 
        canvas will be outputted as. To update the canvas, click on "Update" after selecting the desired shading choice.
    </p>
    <u>Toggling On/Off Light Sources</u>
    <p>
        Below the table to transform cylinders around are two toggle switches that are ON at the start. Each switch 
        corresponds to the appropriate light source labeled. To turn each specific light source ON/OFF, click on the 
        toggle switch as such.
        <b><u>Note:</u> If both the switches are OFF, the objects will only have Ambient Lighting.</b>
    </p>
    <u>Moving the Point Light Source</u>
    <p>
        The Point Light Source is represented as the small yellow sphere on the bottom part of the canvas. 
        If the Point Light Source is toggled to be on, the user can adjust the point light source by adjusting 
        which axes the user wants to move towards. 
    </p>
    <!-- ISSUES -->
    <h3>Issues:</h3>
    <p>
        * At the start of the program, there is a weird light source at the bottom left that is noticeable 
        on the handle of the mallet. Not sure what is causing the problem however it disappears when one of the light 
        source switches has been toggled.
        <br>
        * The normals of the end caps seem to be inverted when applying flat shading and viewing the top left cap 
        of the mallet head cylinder. Before it was only with smooth normals however it is now occurring for flat normals.
        <br>
        * When rotating the z-axis head of the mallet on smooth shading, the colors/lighting changes while the sides/faces 
        remain the same.
        <br>
        * Not 100% sure if this is an issue to care about but something to note. The sphere that represents the point 
        light source seems to only glow when there is directional light and never when the point light is enabled.
