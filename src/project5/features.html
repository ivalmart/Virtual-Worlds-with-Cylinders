    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        An AR Sandbox experience through Android devices where users are able to create a small virtual world through their 
        phone's camera and are able to create objects that have a physics engine. Created through BabylonJS, WEbXR and ARCore, 
        users are given a program to manipulate cones, cylinders, cubes, and spheres. The world created contains objects with 
        lighting and shadows, a reticle used as a cursor for the user to know where objects and effects take place, and a 
        physics engine from BabylonJS to allow interactivity through created effects upon the objects in the world.

    <!-- GUIDE TO RUN AND USE PROGRAM -->
    <h2>Guide to Run Program:</h2>
    <u>How to Run:</u>
    <p>
        The program MUST be running on a live host in order for it to function. There are two 
        sources in which users can try out the AR program.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. GitHub Pages - Users must access the 
        <a href="https://avertec.github.io/ASG_5_BabylonJS/">GitHub Pages</a> link through an Android device 
        in order to get the AR Experience.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Apache Tomcat - Users are able to download the project folder in order to port 
        forward the website to their Android device. Steps to download and run the program are as follows:<br>        
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Download <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi">Apache Tomcat</a> by going to the link and 
            clicking on “32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer” on your PC<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Install Apache Tomcat and find it through Program Files (x86)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Go into Apache Software Foundation -> Tomcat 10.0 -> webapps -> ROOT<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Place the project folder into the ROOT folder<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Start the Apache Tomcat program<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Enable Developer Mode on the Android device and enable “USB Debugging”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Open up Google Chrome on your PC and paste the following into a browser: <b>chrome://inspect/#devices</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Verify if Port Forwarding is enabled and active<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Plug in Android device into PC and open up Google Chrome on the Android device<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <b>Note:</b> To view the perspective of the phone on your PC, go to step (g) for the link and under the “Remote 
            Target” title is where the Android device is. Click on “Inspect”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Paste in the following on Google Chrome in the Port Forwarding page textbox: 
            <b>http://localhost:8080/ASG_5_BabylonJS/index.html</b><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Opening the Program:</h2>
    <p>
        Once the program is up and running on an Android device, the user will see a colored background with buttons 
        on each side providing different functionalities. To enter into AR Mode, tap on the bottom right icon 
        <img src="../../images/program5/arIcon.jpg" width="40px" height="25px">.
    </p>
    <h2>Program Functionality:</h2>
    <u>Physics Engine:</u>
    <p>
        The program has a physics engine depending on the orientation the program entered AR Mode. Objects can move around 
        the world with collision given by the user. There are also two buttons that interact with the objects given force.<br>
        <b>Note:</b> If the user does not create a ground object into the world, the object will fall out of the world and 
        will disappear.
    </p>
    <u>Reticle:</u>
    <p>
        After the world has been generated, a green donut-shaped reticle will appear in the middle of the user's device. It 
        acts as a cursor for the user to place down objects into the world, as well as interact with objects.
    </p>
    <u>Adding Objects:</u>
    <p>
        There are 5 buttons the user can use to create objects. The objects the user can create are: Balls/Spheres, Cubes, 
        Cylinders, Cones, and Slug. When pressed, it drops down the selected object where the cursor is with a random color given 
        onto the world. The "Place Slug" button instead drops down a cube of an image of Sammy the Slug.
    </p>
    <u>Adding Ground:</u>
    <p>
        There is a button "Create Ground" that creates a floor for the user to place down objects on. Depending on where the 
        cursor is will create the ground.
    </p>
    <u>Generating an Explosion/Tornado:</u>
    <p>
        Two buttons "Create Explosion" and "Create Tornado" will generate physics in regards to the button created. Explosions 
        scatter the objects in respect to where the reticle is. Tornados will cause a swirl of objects in respect to the reticle.<br>
        <b>Note:</b> The tornado is very weak in terms of power when pressed. To generate a stronger tornado effect, user can tap 
        the button multiple times.
    </p>
    <u>Resetting the World:</u>
    <p>
        When the "Reset Scene" button is pressed, it will remove all objects of the world to reset the scene to when the program was 
        first opened. 
    </p>

    <!-- ISSUES -->
    <h2>Issues:</h2>
    <p>
        - AR Mode on thr program will not work on PC/Desktop unless there is AR support or an AR emulator.<br>
        - When opening the program and going into Landscape Mode on the device before activating AR Mode, the 
        buttons will overlap each other and appear very large. The buttons will scale to the screen correctly 
        once the user enters AR Mode.<br>
        - Depending on when AR mode is activated in respect to Landscape Mode or Portrait Mode, the physics will 
        only be oriented to when the scene was first created. Example: If the user starts the program on portrait mode 
        and re-enters the program in landscape mode, the physics is bound to portrait mode and objects will fall sideways. 
        - Buttons will seem streteched or squished when the user enters and exits out of AR mode multiple times. 
        Refreshing the page will fix the issue.
    </p>

    <!-- OP-ED -->
    <h2>Op-Ed:</h2>
    <p>
        Our experience of learning how to use AR was a bumpy ride. The minimal resources and documentations that we found were beneficial for 
        the most part and it is what helped us get a footing into the project. There were very few resources and documented APIs
        because most of the programs we were working with either had no support between each other and were 
        a new and ongoing systems that were in development and not fully completed in terms of funtionality. 
        <br>
        We researched the programs we were originally going to use and realized how little documentation there was. Throughout our experience, 
        we had to reduce the scope of our project from what we envisioned. Another factor is programs not being compatible with one another, 
        thus having to adapt our project and visions to something else that provided us those resources. It made us realize that when approaching 
        a new language/program, there might be no one to explain to us how things work efficiently and we would have to learn it ourselves. 
        Since AR is still developing technology, there aren't many external resources such as books to understand more how to utilize AR programs.
